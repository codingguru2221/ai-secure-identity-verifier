# 🔐 AI Secure Digital Identity Verifier

An AI-powered cybersecurity solution to **detect identity fraud** and **secure digital access** in public systems using **Java, AI, and AWS**.



## 📌 Overview

**AI Secure Digital Identity Verifier** is a secure, scalable, and privacy-preserving platform designed to verify digital identity documents and prevent fraud in public and online systems. It combines **Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and cybersecurity best practices** to automate identity verification while maintaining transparency and user trust.

This project is built as part of the **AI for Bharat Hackathon by AWS**, focusing on strengthening **Digital India** by ensuring secure and reliable access to digital services.


## 🎯 Problem Statement

* Identity fraud using fake or edited documents is increasing
* Manual verification is slow, costly, and error-prone
* Existing KYC systems lack transparency and explainability
* Public systems need scalable and secure identity verification



## 💡 Solution

The system verifies identity documents using a **multi-layer AI verification pipeline**:

* OCR-based data extraction
* AI-powered forgery & tampering detection
* Logical and cross-field validation
* Fraud risk scoring with explainable results
* Secure and privacy-first data handling

Instead of a simple approve/reject decision, the system provides **clear explanations** for verification outcomes.



## 🚀 Key Features

* 📄 AI-based identity document verification
* 🔍 OCR-powered data extraction
* 🧠 Forgery & tampering detection
* 📊 Fraud risk scoring (Verified / Suspicious / High Risk)
* 🔐 Cybersecurity-first architecture
* 🧾 Explainable AI results
* 🛡️ Privacy-preserving (no raw data storage)
* 📈 Admin dashboard for monitoring



## 🔁 Process Flow

1. User uploads identity document
2. Image preprocessing & validation
3. OCR extracts key fields
4. AI analyzes document integrity
5. Cross-field validation checks consistency
6. Risk score is generated
7. Final verification result is displayed



## 🏗️ System Architecture

**User Interface → AI Engine (OCR + Fraud Detection) → Risk Scoring Module → Decision Engine → Secure Dashboard**



## 🧰 Technology Stack

### Backend

* **Java (Spring Boot)**
* Maven
* Hibernate / JPA

### AI & Image Processing

* Tesseract OCR (Java Wrapper)
* OpenCV (Java)
* ML Models (Python / ONNX – via REST)

### Cybersecurity

* AES & SHA-256 encryption
* JWT authentication
* Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

### Database

* MySQL / PostgreSQL

### Cloud (AWS)

* AWS EC2 / ECS
* AWS S3 (temporary secure storage)
* AWS RDS
* AWS IAM
* AWS CloudWatch


## 🔐 Security & Privacy

* No permanent storage of identity documents
* Encrypted processing and secure hashing
* Secure APIs with authentication
* Designed to follow data protection principles


## 🌍 Use Cases

* Government portals
* Banks & fintech platforms
* Educational institutions
* Healthcare systems
* Public service applications


## 🇮🇳 Alignment with AI for Bharat Hackathon

* Improves secure access to digital public services
* Supports Digital India initiatives
* Scalable for nationwide adoption
* Built on AWS cloud infrastructure
* Focused on citizen privacy and trust



## 🏆 Why This Project Stands Out

* Strong **AI + Cybersecurity** integration
* Explainable AI for public trust
* Real-world applicability
* Hackathon-ready & scalable architecture
* Java-centric enterprise-grade backend



## 📌 Future Enhancements

* Biometric verification support
* Integration with national digital identity systems
* Advanced ML fraud models
* Mobile application support
* Real-time threat intelligence integration
